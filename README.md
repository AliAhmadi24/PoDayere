# PoDayere
This is one of my early games and long codes which I wrote during my first year of high school, and I recently found it in my old files and decided to share it here.  Despite its simplicity and the bugs it may have, this project holds a special place for me. At the time, I didn’t have much knowledge about writing clean code, OOP, or adding comments, so I apologize if the code is a bit hard to read and is too basic. Additionally, some function and veriable names are written in _Finglish_ (Persian words that are written using the English alphabet).

The game was inspired by the _Pou_ game on Android. Since the character in my game is a circle (in Persian, _dayere_), I named it accordingly.

You may encounter issues installing `graphics.h`, especially on newer versions of Linux. I’ve also included the `.exe` file, so if you prefer, you can run the game directly on Windows.
